## Description
<br>
This is a CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts. The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm in its architectural structure and uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool, and the express-session npm package for authentication. The app is deployed on Heroku.
